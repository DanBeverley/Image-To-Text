## Image Captioning with Deep Learning

# Overview

This project implements an advanced image captioning model that generates natural language descriptions for images. The model leverages the strengths of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for image feature extraction and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) with attention mechanisms for generating coherent and contextually relevant captions. The architecture is inspired by the "Show, Attend, and Tell" approach.

# Dataset

This project uses the Flickr8k dataset, which contains 8,000 images, each annotated with five different captions. The dataset can be downloaded from Kaggle. Ensure the dataset is organized as follows:

data/
|--Images/
|--captions.txt

The captions file should be preprocessed to remove special characters, convert to lowercase, and tokenize words. This is done automatically during the preprocessing step.

## Model Architecture
The model consists of two main components:

1.Encoder (CNN): A pre-trained Convolutional Neural Network, such as InceptionV3 or ResNet50, is used to extract feature vectors from images. The final convolutional layer of the CNN provides a feature map that serves as the input to the decoder.

2.Decoder (RNN with Attention): The decoder is an RNN, typically an LSTM or GRU, that generates the caption word by word. An attention mechanism is employed to allow the model to focus on different parts of the image at each time step, making the generated captions more relevant and accurate.

# Key Features
- Pre-trained CNN Encoder: Uses a pre-trained CNN model to extract features, reducing training time and improving performance.
- Attention Mechanism: Incorporates an attention mechanism that dynamically weighs image features to focus on relevant regions when generating each word of the caption.
Bidirectional RNN: Optionally, the decoder can be a bidirectional RNN, which may improve the context understanding.

# Requirements
The following Python packages are required to run the project:
PIL
keras
numpy
pandas
tensorflow
matplotlib
scikit-learn
You can install these dependencies using:
pip install -r requirements.txt

## Troubleshooting
- Out of Memory (OOM) Errors: Reduce the batch size or use a smaller model.
- Model Convergence Issues: Experiment with different learning rates or use a learning rate scheduler.
- Inconsistent Captions: Ensure that your dataset is correctly preprocessed and that the tokenizer is properly configured.

## Future Work
- Model Optimization: Explore using transformer-based models for improved performance.
- Dataset Expansion: Use larger datasets such as MS COCO for training to improve caption quality.
- Real-Time Captioning: Implement real-time image captioning using a webcam or video input.
